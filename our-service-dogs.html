        My daughter was born with Cerebral Palsy. She has an awesome service dog, Riley, to help her get around in the situations where a wheelchair and walker just don't cut it (stairs, the beach, a grassy hill... you get it). Turns out, there are loads of other children with special needs who's lives have all been enriched by having a service dog. "Our Service Dogs" features 8 of those other real-life teams. "Our Service Dogs" is a book about service dogs that shows the service dog community in its true light, as well as gives some tips for kids to know what to do when they see a service dog at school with a classmate or in public (hint: no petting!)
